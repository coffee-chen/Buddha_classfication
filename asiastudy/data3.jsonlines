{"label": 1, "text": "which has no distinguishing mark."}
{"label": 1, "text": "as we ascend from outer material things which are permeated by separateness, and whose chief characteristic is to be separate, just as so many pebbles are separate from each other; as we ascend, first, to mind-images, which overlap and coalesce in both space and time, and then to ideas and principles, we finally come to purer essences, drawing ever nearer and nearer to unity."}

{"label": 1, "text": "our bodily, external selves are quite distinct and separate, in form, name, place, substance; our mental selves, of finer substance, meet and part, meet and part again, in perpetual concussion and interchange; our spiritual selves attain true consciousness through unity, where the partition wall between us and the highest, between us and others, is broken down and we are all made perfect in the one."}

{"label": 1, "text": "or, to use the phrase we have already adopted, the aim of these practices is, to help the spiritual man to open his eyes; to help him also to throw aside the veils and disguises, the enmeshing psychic nets which surround him, tying his hands, as it were, and bandaging his eyes."}
{"label": 1, "text": "and this, as all teachers testify, is a long and arduous task, a steady up-hill fight, demanding fine courage and persistent toil."}

{"label": 1, "text": "let us try to translate this into terms of the psychical and spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "the darkness of unwisdom is, primarily, the self-absorption of the psychical man, his complete preoccupation with his own hopes and fears, plans and purposes, sensations and desires; so that he fails to see, or refuses to see, that there is a spiritual man; and so doggedly resists all efforts of the spiritual man to cast off his psychic tyrant and set himself free."}
{"label": 1, "text": "this is the real darkness; and all those who deny the immortality of the soul, or deny the soul's existence, and so lay out their lives wholly for the psychical, mortal man and his ambitions, are under this power of darkness."}
{"label": 1, "text": "born of this darkness, this psychic self-absorption, is the dogged conviction that the psychic, personal man has separate, exclusive interests, which he can follow for himself alone; and this conviction, when put into practice in our life, leads to contest with other personalities, and so to hate."}
{"label": 1, "text": "this hate, again, makes against the spiritual man, since it hinders the revelation of the high harmony between the spiritual man and his other selves, a harmony to be revealed only through the practice of love, that perfect love which casts out fear."}
{"label": 1, "text": "in like manner, lust is the psychic man's craving for the stimulus of sensation, the din of which smothers the voice of the spiritual man, as, in shakespeare's phrase, the cackling geese would drown the song of the nightingale."}
{"label": 1, "text": "and this craving for stimulus is the fruit of weakness, coming from the failure to find strength in the primal life of the spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "attachment is but another name for psychic self-absorption; for we are absorbed, not in outward things, but rather in their images within our minds; our inner eyes are fixed on them; our inner desires brood over them; and em we blind ourselves to the presence of the prisoner' the enmeshed and fettered spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "hindrances may be dormant, or worn thin, or suspended, or expanded."}
{"label": 1, "text": "here we have really two sutras in one."}
{"label": 1, "text": "the first has been explained already in the darkness of unwisdom grow the parasites, hate, lust, attachment."}
{"label": 1, "text": "they are all outgrowths of the self-absorption of the psychical self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "next, we are told that these barriers may be either dormant, or suspended, or expanded, or worn thin."}
{"label": 1, "text": "faults which are dormant will be brought out through the pressure of life, or through the pressure of strong aspiration."}
{"label": 1, "text": "thus expanded, they must be fought and conquered, or, as patanjali quaintly says, they must be worn thin,-as a veil might, or the links of manacles."}
{"label": 1, "text": "impure, full of pain, not the soul, to be eternal, pure, full of joy, the soul."}
{"label": 1, "text": "this we have really considered already."}
{"label": 1, "text": "the psychic man is unenduring, impure, full of pain, not the soul, not the real self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "the spiritual man is enduring, pure, full of joy, the real self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "the darkness of unwisdom is, therefore, the self-absorption of the psychical, personal man, to the exclusion of the spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "it is the belief, carried into action, that the personal man is the real man, the man for whom we should toil, for whom we should build, for whom we should live."}
{"label": 1, "text": "this is that psychical man of whom it is said he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption."}
{"label": 1, "text": "of vision as forming one self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "this is the fundamental idea of the sankhya philosophy, of which the yoga is avowedly the practical side."}
{"label": 1, "text": "to translate this into our terms, we may say that the seer is the spiritual man; the instrument of vision is the psychical man, through which the spiritual man gains experience of the outer world."}
{"label": 1, "text": "but we turn the servant into the master."}
{"label": 1, "text": "we attribute to the psychical man, the personal self, a reality which really belongs to the spiritual man alone; and so, thinking of the quality of the spiritual man as belonging to the psychical, we merge the spiritual man in the psychical; or, as the text says, we think of the two as forming one self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "this has been explained again and again."}
{"label": 1, "text": "sensation, as, for example, the sense of taste, is meant to be the guide to action; in this case, the choice of wholesome food, and the avoidance of poisonous and hurtful things."}
{"label": 1, "text": "but if we rest in the sense of taste, as a pleasure in itself; rest, that is, in the psychical side of taste, we fall into gluttony, and live to eat, instead of eating to live."}
{"label": 1, "text": "so with the other great organic power, the power of reproduction."}
{"label": 1, "text": "this lust comes into being, through resting in the sensation, and looking for pleasure from that."}
{"label": 1, "text": "pain comes, for the most part, from the strife of personalities, the jarring discords between psychic selves, each of which deems itself supreme."}
{"label": 1, "text": "a dwelling on this pain breeds hate, which tears the warring selves yet further asunder, and puts new enmity between them, thus hindering the harmony of the real, the reconciliation through the soul."}

{"label": 1, "text": "the life here desired is the psychic life, the intensely vibrating life of the psychical self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "this prevails even in those who have attained much wisdom, so long as it falls short of the wisdom of complete renunciation, complete obedience to each least behest of the spiritual man, and of the master who guards and aids the spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "the desire of sensation, the desire of psychic life, reproduces itself, carried on by its own energy and momentum; and hence comes the circle of death and rebirth, death and rebirth, instead of the liberation of the spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "removed by a countercurrent."}
{"label": 1, "text": "the darkness of unwisdom is to be removed by the light of wisdom, pursued through fervour, spiritual reading of holy teachings and of life itself, and by obedience to the master."}
{"label": 1, "text": "lust is to be removed by pure aspiration of spiritual life, which, bringing true strength and stability, takes away the void of weakness which we try to fill by the stimulus of sensations."}
{"label": 1, "text": "hate is to be overcome by love."}
