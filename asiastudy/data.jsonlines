{"label": 1, "text": "That is distinct from known and also It is beyond the unknown."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Therefore it was necessary for the teacher to remind the disciple that knowledge based on sense-perception or intellectual apprehension should not be confounded with supersensuous knowledge."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Although the disciple had listened to the teacher with unquestioning mind and was intellectually convinced of the truth of his words, it was now necessary for him to prove by his own experience what he had heard."}

{"label": 1, "text": "By this text the teacher confirms the idea that Brahman is unthinkable, because unconditioned."}

{"label": 1, "text": "By attaining this Self, man gains strength; and by Self-knowledge immortality is attained."}
{"label": 1, "text": "We have learned from the previous text that the Brahman is unknown to those whose knowledge is limited to sense experience; but He is not unknown to those whose purified intelligence perceives Him as the basis of all states of consciousness and the essence of all things."}
{"label": 1, "text": "By this higher knowledge a man attains immortality, because he knows that although his body may decay and die, the subtle essence of his being remains untouched."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Such an one also acquires unlimited strength, because he identifies himself with the ultimate Source."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The strength which comes from one's own muscle and brain or from one's individual power must be limited and mortal and therefore cannot lift one beyond death; but through the strength which Atma-gnana or Self-knowledge gives, immortality is reached."}

{"label": 1, "text": "It is through His power that you live and act."}
{"label": 1, "text": "He is the agent and you are all only instruments in His hands."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Therefore your idea that 'This victory is ours, this glory is ours,' is based on ignorance."}
{"label": 1, "text": "At once Indra saw their mistake."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The Devas, being puffed up with vanity, had thought they themselves had achieved the victory, whereas it was Brahman; for not even a blade of grass can move without His command."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Therefore these Devas,--Agni, Vayu and Indra--excel other Devas, because they came nearer to Brahman."}
{"label": 1, "text": "It was they who first knew this spirit as Brahman."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Therefore Indra excels all other Devas, because he came nearest to Brahman, and because he first (before all others) knew this spirit as Brahman."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Agni, Vayu and Indra were superior to the other Devas because they gained a closer vision; and they were able to do this because they were purer; while Indra stands as the head of the Devas, because he realized the Truth directly, he reached Brahman."}

{"label": 1, "text": "As we ascend from outer material things which are permeated by separateness, and whose chief characteristic is to be separate, just as so many pebbles are separate from each other; as we ascend, first, to mind-images, which overlap and coalesce in both space and time, and then to ideas and principles, we finally come to purer essences, drawing ever nearer and nearer to unity."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Or we may illustrate this principle thus."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Our bodily, external selves are quite distinct and separate, in form, name, place, substance; our mental selves, of finer substance, meet and part, meet and part again, in perpetual concussion and interchange; our spiritual selves attain true consciousness through unity, where the partition wall between us and the Highest, between us and others, is broken down and we are all made perfect in the One."}

{"label": 1, "text": "The aim of fervour, spiritual reading and obedience to the Master, is, to bring soulvision, and to wear away hindrances."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Or, to use the phrase we have already adopted, the aim of these practices is, to help the spiritual man to open his eyes; to help him also to throw aside the veils and disguises, the enmeshing psychic nets which surround him, tying his hands, as it were, and bandaging his eyes."}
{"label": 1, "text": "And this, as all teachers testify, is a long and arduous task, a steady up-hill fight, demanding fine courage and persistent toil."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Fervour, the fire of the spiritual will, is, as we said, two-fold: it illumines, and so helps the spiritual man to see; and it also burns up the nets and meshes which ensnare the spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "So with the other means, spiritual reading and obedience."}

{"label": 1, "text": "lust hate, attachment."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Let us try to translate this into terms of the psychical and spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The darkness of unwisdom is, primarily, the self-absorption of the psychical man, his complete preoccupation with his own hopes and fears, plans and purposes, sensations and desires; so that he fails to see, or refuses to see, that there is a spiritual man; and so doggedly resists all efforts of the spiritual man to cast off his psychic tyrant and set himself free."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This is the real darkness; and all those who deny the immortality of the soul, or deny the soul's existence, and so lay out their lives wholly for the psychical, mortal man and his ambitions, are under this power of darkness."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Born of this darkness, this psychic self-absorption, is the dogged conviction that the psychic, personal man has separate, exclusive interests, which he can follow for himself alone; and this conviction, when put into practice in our life, leads to contest with other personalities, and so to hate."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This hate, again, makes against the spiritual man, since it hinders the revelation of the high harmony between the spiritual man and his other selves, a harmony to be revealed only through the practice of love, that perfect love which casts out fear."}
{"label": 1, "text": "In like manner, lust is the psychic man's craving for the stimulus of sensation, the din of which smothers the voice of the spiritual man, as, in Shakespeare's phrase, the cackling geese would drown the song of the nightingale."}
{"label": 1, "text": "And this craving for stimulus is the fruit of weakness, coming from the failure to find strength in the primal life of the spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Attachment is but another name for psychic self-absorption; for we are absorbed, not in outward things, but rather in their images within our minds; our inner eyes are fixed on them; our inner desires brood over them; and em we blind ourselves to the presence of the prisoner' the enmeshed and fettered spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "hindrances may be dormant, or worn thin, or suspended, or expanded."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Here we have really two Sutras in one."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The first has been explained already: in the darkness of unwisdom grow the parasites, hate, lust, attachment."}
{"label": 1, "text": "They are all outgrowths of the self-absorption of the psychical self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Next, we are told that these barriers may be either dormant, or suspended, or expanded, or worn thin."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Faults which are dormant will be brought out through the pressure of life, or through the pressure of strong aspiration."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Thus expanded, they must be fought and conquered, or, as Patanjali quaintly says, they must be worn thin,-as a veil might, or the links of manacles."}
{"label": 1, "text": "impure, full of pain, not the Soul, to be eternal, pure, full of joy, the Soul."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This we have really considered already."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The psychic man is unenduring, impure, full of pain, not the Soul, not the real Self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The spiritual man is enduring, pure, full of joy, the real Self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The darkness of unwisdom is, therefore, the self-absorption of the psychical, personal man, to the exclusion of the spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "It is the belief, carried into action, that the personal man is the real man, the man for whom we should toil, for whom we should build, for whom we should live."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This is that psychical man of whom it is said: he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption."}
{"label": 1, "text": "of vision as forming one self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This is the fundamental idea of the Sankhya philosophy, of which the Yoga is avowedly the practical side."}
{"label": 1, "text": "To translate this into our terms, we may say that the Seer is the spiritual man; the instrument of vision is the psychical man, through which the spiritual man gains experience of the outer world."}
{"label": 1, "text": "But we turn the servant into the master."}
{"label": 1, "text": "We attribute to the psychical man, the personal self, a reality which really belongs to the spiritual man alone; and so, thinking of the quality of the spiritual man as belonging to the psychical, we merge the spiritual man in the psychical; or, as the text says, we think of the two as forming one self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This has been explained again and again."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Sensation, as, for example, the sense of taste, is meant to be the guide to action; in this case, the choice of wholesome food, and the avoidance of poisonous and hurtful things."}
{"label": 1, "text": "But if we rest in the sense of taste, as a pleasure in itself; rest, that is, in the psychical side of taste, we fall into gluttony, and live to eat, instead of eating to live."}
{"label": 1, "text": "So with the other great organic power, the power of reproduction."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This lust comes into being, through resting in the sensation, and looking for pleasure from that."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pain comes, for the most part, from the strife of personalities, the jarring discords between psychic selves, each of which deems itself supreme."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A dwelling on this pain breeds hate, which tears the warring selves yet further asunder, and puts new enmity between them, thus hindering the harmony of the Real, the reconciliation through the Soul."}
{"label": 1, "text": "forward by its own energy."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The life here desired is the psychic life, the intensely vibrating life of the psychical self."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This prevails even in those who have attained much wisdom, so long as it falls short of the wisdom of complete renunciation, complete obedience to each least behest of the spiritual man, and of the Master who guards and aids the spiritual man."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The desire of sensation, the desire of psychic life, reproduces itself, carried on by its own energy and momentum; and hence comes the circle of death and rebirth, death and rebirth, instead of the liberation of the spiritual man."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Perfectly concentrated Meditation on the nature of this force means, first, that rising of the consciousness into the spiritual world, already described, which gives the one sure foothold for Meditation; and then, from that spiritual point of vantage, not only an insight into the creative force, in its spiritual and physical aspects, but also a gradually attained control of this wonderful force, which will mean its direction to the body of the spiritual man, and its gradual withdrawal from the body of the natural man, until the over-pressure, so general and such a fruitful source of misery in our day, is abated, and purity takes the place of passion."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This over pressure, which is the cause of so many evils and so much of human shame, is an abnormal, not a natural, condition."}
{"label": 1, "text": "It is primarily due to spiritual blindness, to blindness regarding the spiritual man, and ignorance even of his existence; for by this blind ignorance are closed the channels through which, were they open, the creative force could flow into the body of the spiritual man, there building up an immortal vesture."}

{"label": 1, "text": "But the text seems to mean more than this and to have in view the vesture of the colour of the sun attributed by the Upanishads to the spiritual man; that vesture which a disciple has thus described: The Lord shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body; perhaps body of radiance would better translate the Greek."}
