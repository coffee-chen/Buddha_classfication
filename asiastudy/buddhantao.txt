§ 1.The Buddha: "What do you think, Rahula: What is a mirror for?"The Buddha:Rahula: "For reflection, sir."Rahula:The Buddha: "In the same way, Rahula, bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection.The Buddha:"Whenever you want to perform a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I want to perform — would it lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results, then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do.(Similarly with verbal acts & mental acts.)"While you are performing a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I am doing — is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to affliction of others, or both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it.(Similarly with verbal acts & mental acts.)"Having performed a bodily act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should confess it, reveal it, lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life. Having confessed it... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed & joyful, training day & night in skillful mental qualities.(Similarly with verbal acts.)"Having performed a mental act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should feel horrified, humiliated, & disgusted with it. Feeling horrified... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed & joyful, training day & night in skillful mental qualities."Rahula, all the brahmans & contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts, did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts in just this way."All the brahmans & contemplatives in the course of the future... All the brahmans & contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts, do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts in just this way."And so, Rahula, you should train yourself: 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection. I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection. I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection.' That's how you should train yourself."That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Rahula delighted in the Blessed One's words.

§ 2.Once the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa tree grove. Then, picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his hand, he asked the monks, "What do you think, monks: Which are more numerous, the few Simsapa leaves in my hand or those overhead in the Simsapa grove?""The leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number, lord. Those overhead in the grove are far more numerous.""In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerous than the things I have taught. And why haven't I taught them? Because they are not connected with the goal, do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That is why I have not taught them."And what have I taught? 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.' This is what I have taught. And why have I taught these things? Because they are connected with the goal, relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. This is why I have taught them."Therefore your duty is the contemplation, 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'"

§ 3."'Stress should be known. The cause by which stress comes into play should be known. The diversity in stress should be known. The result of stress should be known. The cessation of stress should be known. The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known.' Thus it has been said. Why was it said?"Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful; association with what is not loved is stressful, separation from what is loved is stressful, not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful."And what is the cause by which stress comes into play? Craving is the cause by which stress comes into play."And what is the diversity in stress? There is major stress & minor, slowly fading & quickly fading. This is called the diversity in stress."And what is the result of stress? There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, & becomes bewildered. Or one overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, comes to search outside, 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?' I tell you, monks, that stress results either in bewilderment or in search."And what is the cessation of stress? The cessation of craving is the cessation of stress, and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration."Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns stress in this way, the cause by which stress comes into play in this way, the diversity of stress in this way, the result of stress in this way, the cessation of stress in this way, & the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in this way, then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of stress."'Stress should be known. The cause by which stress comes into play... The variations in stress... The result of stress... The cessation of stress... The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be experienced.' Thus it has been said, and this is why it was said."

This is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress... This noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed... This noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developed.'"And, monks, as long as this knowledge & vision of mine — with its three rounds & twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are — was not pure, I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening... But as soon as this knowledge & vision of mine — with its three rounds & twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are — was truly pure, only then did I claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening... The knowledge & vision arose in me: 'Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further becoming.'"was

§ 6.Sariputta: "Now what, friends, is the noble truth of stress? Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful; not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.Sariputta:"Now what is birth?

Whatever despair, despondency, desperation of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing, that is called despair.despair?"And what is the stress of not getting what one wants? In beings subject to birth, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to birth, and may birth not come to us.' But this is not to be achieved by wishing. This is the stress of not getting what one wants. In beings subject to aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair, and may aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair not come to us.' But this is not to be achieved by wishing. This is the stress of not getting what one wants."And what are the five clinging-aggregates that, in short, are stressful? Form as a clinging-aggregate, feeling as a clinging-aggregate, perception as a clinging-aggregate, fabrications as a clinging-aggregate, consciousness as a clinging-aggregate: These are called the five clinging-aggregates that, in short, are stressful."This is called the noble truth of stress."

§ 7.At Savatthi. There the Blessed One said, "Monks, I will teach you the five aggregates & the five clinging-aggregates. Listen & pay close attention. I will speak.""As you say, lord," the monks responded.The Blessed One said, "Now what, monks, are the five aggregates?"Whatever form is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the form aggregate."Whatever feeling is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the feeling aggregate."Whatever perception is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the perception aggregate."Whatever (mental) fabrications are past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: those are called the fabrication aggregate."Whatever consciousness is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the consciousness aggregate."These are called the five aggregates."And what are the five clinging-aggregates?"Whatever form — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental fermentation: that is called form as clinging-aggregate."Whatever feeling — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental fermentation: that is called feeling as a clinging-aggregate."Whatever perception — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental fermentation: that is called perception as a clinging-aggregate."Whatever (mental) fabrications — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — are clingable, offer sustenance, and are accompanied with mental fermentation: those are called fabrication as a clinging-aggregate."Whatever consciousness — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental fermentation: that is called consciousness as a clinging-aggregate."These are called the five clinging-aggregates."

§ 8.The Buddha: "These are the five clinging-aggregates: form as a clinging-aggregate, feeling as a clinging-aggregate, perception as a clinging-aggregate, fabrications as a clinging-aggregate, consciousness as a clinging-aggregate... These five clinging-aggregates are rooted in desire..."The Buddha:A certain monk: "Is it the case that clinging and the five clinging-aggregates are the same thing, or are they separate?"A certain monk:The Buddha: "Clinging is neither the same thing as the five clinging-aggregates, nor are they separate. Whatever desire & passion there is with regard to the five clinging-aggregates, that is the clinging there..."The Buddha:The monk: "What is the cause, what is the condition, for the discernibility of the form aggregate... feeling aggregate... perception aggregate... fabrications aggregate... consciousness aggregate?"The monk:The Buddha: "The four great existents [the properties of earth, water, fire, & wind] are the cause & condition for the discernibility of the form aggregate. Contact is the cause & condition for the discernibility of the feeling... perception... fabrications aggregate. Name & form are the cause & condition for the discernibility of the consciousness aggregate."The Buddha:

§ 9."And why do you call it 'form' (rupa)? Because it is afflicted (ruppati), thus it is called 'form.' Afflicted with what? With cold & heat & hunger & thirst, with the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, & reptiles. Because it is afflicted, it is called form.(rupa)?(ruppati),"And why do you call it 'feeling'? Because it feels, thus it is called 'feeling.' What does it feel? It feels pleasure, it feels pain, it feels neither-pleasure-nor-pain. Because it feels, it is called feeling."And why do you call it 'perception'? Because it perceives, thus it is called 'perception.' What does it perceive? It perceives blue, it perceives yellow, it perceives red, it perceives white. Because it perceives, it is called perception."And why do you call them 'fabrications'? Because they fabricate fabricated things, thus they are called 'fabrications.' What do they fabricate as a fabricated thing? From form-ness, they fabricate form as a fabricated thing. From feeling-ness, they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing. From perception-hood...From fabrication-hood...From consciousness-hood, they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thing. Because they fabricate fabricated things, they are called fabrications."And why do you call it 'consciousness'? Because it cognizes, thus it is called consciousness. What does it cognize? It cognizes what is sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, alkaline, non-alkaline, salty, & unsalty. Because it cognizes, it is called consciousness."

§ 11. Form.§ 11.Sariputta: "And what, friends, is form as a clinging-aggregate? The four great existents and the form derived from them. And what are the four great existents? They are the earth-property, the water property, the fire property, & the wind property.Sariputta:"And what is the earth property? The earth property may be either internal or external. What is the internal earth property? Whatever internal, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, & sustained: head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, feces, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, & sustained: This is called the internal earth property. Now both the internal earth property and the external earth property are simply earth property. And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the earth property fade from the mind..."And what is the water property? The water property may be either internal or external. What is the internal water property? Whatever internal, belonging to oneself, is liquid, watery, & sustained: bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-oil, saliva, mucus, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is liquid, watery, & sustained: This is called the internal water property.

Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as neither gratifying nor hurting is neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling... Pleasant feeling is pleasant in remaining and painful in changing.

§ 17."Now what is the noble truth of the origination of stress? The craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here & now there — i.e., craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming...

§ 18."And what is the noble method that is rightly seen & rightly ferreted out by discernment? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices: When this is, that is. From the arising of this comes the arising of that. When this isn't, that isn't. From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that. "With ignorance as a condition there are fabrications. 			With fabrications as a condition there is consciousness. 			With consciousness as a condition there is name & form. 			With name & form as a condition there are the six sense spheres. 			With the six sense spheres as a condition there is contact. 			With contact as a condition there is feeling. 			With feeling as a condition there is craving. 			With craving as a condition there is clinging/sustenance. 			With clinging/sustenance as a condition there is becoming. 			With becoming as a condition there is birth. 			With birth as a condition, then old age & death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress & suffering."Now from the remainderless fading & cessation of that very ignorance there is the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications there is the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness there is the cessation of name & form. From the cessation of name & form there is the cessation of the six sense spheres. From the cessation of the six sense spheres there is the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling there is the cessation of craving. From the cessation of craving there is the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance there is the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming there is the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth, then old age & death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair all cease.

§ 23."One attached is unreleased; one unattached is released. Should consciousness, when standing (still), stand attached to (a physical) form, supported by form (as its object), established on form, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, & development. Should consciousness, when standing (still), stand attached to feeling... to perception... to fabrications... it would exhibit growth, increase, & development. Were someone to say, 'I will describe a coming, a going, a passing away, an arising, a growth, an increase or a development of consciousness apart from form, from feeling, from perception, from fabrications,' that would be impossible."If a monk abandons passion for the property of form... feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness, then owing to the abandoning of passion, the support is cut off, and consciousness is unestablished. Consciousness, thus unestablished, undeveloped, not performing any function, is released. Owing to its release, it stays firm. Owing to its staying firm, it is contented. Owing to its contentment, it is not agitated. Not agitated, he (the monk) is totally unbound right within himself. He discerns that, 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'"

§ 24."There are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be born. What four? Physical food, gross or refined; contact as the second, consciousness the third, and intellectual intention the fourth. These are the four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be born."Where there is passion, delight, & craving for the nutriment of physical food, consciousness lands there and grows. Where consciousness lands and grows, name & form alight. Where name & form alight, there is the growth of fabrications. Where there is the growth of fabrications, there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging, & death, together, I tell you, with sorrow, affliction, & despair."Just as — when there is dye, lac, yellow orpiment, indigo, or crimson — a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man, complete in all its parts, on a well-polished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth; in the same way, where there is passion, delight, & craving for the nutriment of physical food, consciousness lands there & grows... together, I tell you, with sorrow, affliction, & despair.(Similarly with the other three kinds of nutriment.)"Where there is no passion for physical nutriment, where there is no delight, no craving, consciousness does not land there or grow... Name & form do not alight... There is no growth of fabrications... There is no production of renewed becoming in the future. Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future, there is no future birth, aging, & death. That, I tell you, has no sorrow, affliction, or despair."Just as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north, the south, or the east. When the sun rises, and a ray has entered by way of the window, where does it land?""On the western wall, lord.""And if there is no western wall...?""On the ground, lord.""And if there is no ground...?""On the water, lord.""And if there is no water...?""It does not land, lord.""In the same way, where there is no passion for physical nutriment... consciousness does not land or grow...

That which is devoted to sensual pleasure in connection with sensuality: base, domestic, common, ignoble, unprofitable; and that which is devoted to self-affliction: painful, ignoble, unprofitable. Avoiding both of these extremes, the middle way realized by the Tathagata — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding."And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding? Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding."

§ 30. Analysis of the Path.§ 30."Monks, what is the noble eightfold path? Right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration."And what is right view? Knowledge with regard to stress, knowledge with regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress: This is called right view."And what is right resolve? Resolve aimed at freedom from sensuality, at freedom from ill will, at harmlessness: This is called right resolve."And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, & from idle chatter: This is called right speech."And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, from stealing, & from unchastity. This is called right action."And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood."And what is right effort? There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds, & exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen... for the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen... for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen...(and) for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, & culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen: This is called right effort."And what is right mindfulness? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting away greed & distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in & of themselves... the mind in & of itself... mental qualities in & of themselves — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world. This is called right mindfulness."And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities — enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation — internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress — he enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration."

§ 31."Suppose a man in need of oil, looking for oil, wandering in search of oil, would pile gravel in a tub and press it, sprinkling it again & again with water. If he were to pile gravel in a tub and press it, sprinkling it again & again with water even when having made a wish [for results] ... having made no wish ... both having made a wish and having made no wish ... neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, he would be incapable of obtaining results. Why is that? Because it is an inappropriate way of obtaining results."In the same way, any brahmans or contemplatives endowed with wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, & wrong concentration: If they follow the holy life even when having made a wish [for results] ... having made no wish... both having made a wish and having made no wish ... neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, they are incapable of obtaining results.

§ 32."Monks, ignorance is the leader in the attainment of unskillful qualities, followed by lack of conscience & lack of concern.

In one of wrong action, wrong livelihood... In one of wrong livelihood, wrong effort... In one of wrong effort, wrong mindfulness...

§ 33.Ven. Ananda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "This is half of the holy life, lord: having admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues.""Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Having admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, he can be expected to develop & pursue the noble eightfold path."And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, develop & pursue the noble eightfold path? There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops right resolve ... right speech ... right action ... right livelihood ... right effort ... right mindfulness ... right concentration dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, develops & pursues the noble eightfold path."And through this line of reasoning one may know how having admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life: It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair have gained release from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair. It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how having admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life."

§ 34. More on Right View.§ 34."And how is right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong view as wrong view. One discerns right view as right view. This is one's right view. And what is wrong view? 'There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no brahmans or contemplatives who, faring rightly & practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next after having directly known & realized it for themselves.' This is wrong view."And what is right view? Right view, I tell you, is of two sorts: There is right view with fermentations, siding with merit, resulting in the paraphernalia (of becoming); and there is noble right view, free from fermentations, transcendent, a factor of the path."And what is the right view that has fermentations, sides with merit, & results in paraphernalia? 'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits & results of good & bad actions. There is this world & the next world. There is mother & father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are brahmans & contemplatives who, faring rightly & practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next after having directly known & realized it for themselves.' This is the right view that has fermentations, sides with merit, & results in paraphernalia."And what is the right view that is free from fermentations, transcendent, a factor of the path? The discernment, the faculty of discernment, the strength of discernment, analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening, the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is free from fermentations, who is fully possessed of the noble path. This is the right view that is free from fermentations, transcendent, a factor of the path."One tries to abandon wrong view & to enter into right view: This is one's right effort. One is mindful to abandon wrong view & to enter & remain in right view: This is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three qualities — right view, right effort, & right mindfulness — run & circle around right view."

§ 35. More on Right Action & Right Speech.§ 35."Having thus gone forth, following the training & way of life of the monks, abandoning the taking of life, he abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, kind, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what is given, accepts only what is given, lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure. Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life, aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way.

§ 36. More on Right Action & Right Speech for Lay People.§ 36."Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct. He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned with flowers by another man."Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. When he has been called to a town meeting, a group meeting, a gathering of his relatives, his guild, or of the royalty (i.e., a royal court proceeding), if he is asked as a witness, 'Come & tell, good man, what you know': If he doesn't know, he says, 'I don't know.' If he does know, he says, 'I know.' If he hasn't seen, he says, 'I haven't seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I have seen.' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake of another, or for the sake of any reward."

§ 37. Right Mindfulness.§ 37."This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow & lamentation, for the disappearance of pain & distress, for the attainment of the right method, & for the realization of Unbinding — in other words, the four frames of reference. What four?"There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings... mind... mental qualities in & of themselves — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world."Body"And how is does the monk remain focused on the body in & of itself? There is the case of a monk who, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore [lit: to the front of the chest]. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out."Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.' Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn, discerns, 'I am making a long turn,' or when making a short turn discerns, 'I am making a short turn'; in the same way the monk, when breathing in long, discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long' ... He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.'Just as"In this way he remains focused internally on the body in & of itself, or externally on the body in & of itself, or both internally & externally on the body in & of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination & passing away with regard to the body. Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself."Furthermore, when walking, the monk discerns, 'I am walking.' When standing, he discerns, 'I am standing.' When sitting, he discerns, 'I am sitting.' When lying down, he discerns, 'I am lying down.' Or however his body is disposed, that is how he discerns it."In this way he remains focused internally on the body in & of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself."Furthermore, when going forward & returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward & looking away... when bending & extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe & his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, & savoring... when urinating & defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, & remaining silent, he makes himself fully alert."In this way he remains focused internally on the body in & of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself."Furthermore... just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain — wheat, rice, mung beans, kidney beans, sesame seeds, husked rice — and a man with good eyesight, pouring it out, were to reflect, 'This is wheat. This is rice. These are mung beans. These are kidney beans. These are sesame seeds. This is husked rice,' in the same way, monks, a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up, from the crown of the head on down, surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things: 'In this body there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, gorge, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-oil, saliva, mucus, fluid in the joints, urine.'"In this way he remains focused internally on the body in & of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world.

This is how a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself."Furthermore, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground — one day, two days, three days dead — bloated, livid, & festering, he applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate'..."Or again, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground, picked at by crows, vultures, & hawks, by dogs, hyenas, & various other creatures... a skeleton smeared with flesh & blood, connected with tendons... a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, connected with tendons... a skeleton without flesh or blood, connected with tendons... bones detached from their tendons, scattered in all directions — here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone, here a hip bone, there a back bone, here a rib, there a breast bone, here a shoulder bone, there a neck bone, here a jaw bone, there a tooth, here a skull... the bones whitened, somewhat like the color of shells... piled up, more than a year old... decomposed into a powder: He applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate.'"In this way he remains focused internally on the body in & of itself, or externally on the body in & of itself, or both internally & externally on the body in & of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination & passing away with regard to the body. Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself."Feelings"And how does a monk remain focused on feelings in & of themselves? There is the case where a monk, when feeling a painful feeling, discerns, 'I am feeling a painful feeling.' When feeling a pleasant feeling, he discerns, 'I am feeling a pleasant feeling.' When feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he discerns, 'I am feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'"When feeling a painful feeling of the flesh, he discerns, 'I am feeling a painful feeling of the flesh.' When feeling a painful feeling not of the flesh, he discerns, 'I am feeling a painful feeling not of the flesh.'

Or his mindfulness that 'There are feelings' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on feelings in & of themselves."Mind"And how does a monk remain focused on the mind in & of itself? There is the case where a monk, when the mind has passion, discerns that the mind has passion. When the mind is without passion, he discerns that the mind is without passion. When the mind has aversion, he discerns that the mind has aversion. When the mind is without aversion, he discerns that the mind is without aversion. When the mind has delusion, he discerns that the mind has delusion. When the mind is without delusion, he discerns that the mind is without delusion."When the mind is restricted, he discerns that the mind is restricted. When the mind is scattered, he discerns that the mind is scattered. When the mind is enlarged, he discerns that the mind is enlarged. When the mind is not enlarged, he discerns that the mind is not enlarged. When the mind is surpassed, he discerns that the mind is surpassed. When the mind is unsurpassed, he discerns that the mind is unsurpassed. When the mind is concentrated, he discerns that the mind is concentrated. When the mind is not concentrated, he discerns that the mind is not concentrated. When the mind is released, he discerns that the mind is released. When the mind is not released, he discerns that the mind is not released."In this way he remains focused internally on the mind in & of itself, or externally on the mind in & of itself, or both internally & externally on the mind in & of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the mind, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the mind, or on the phenomenon of origination & passing away with regard to the mind. Or his mindfulness that 'There is a mind' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the mind in & of itself."Mental Qualities"And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in & of themselves? There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental qualities in & of themselves with reference to the five hindrances."And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in & of themselves with reference to the five hindrances? There is the case where, there being sensual desire present within, a monk discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me.' Or, there being no sensual desire present within, he discerns that 'There is no sensual desire present within me.' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire. And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen. And he discerns how there is no future arising of sensual desire that has been abandoned. [The same formula is repeated for the remaining hindrances: ill will, sloth & drowsiness, restlessness & anxiety, and doubt.]"In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in & of themselves, or externally on mental qualities in & of themselves, or both internally & externally on mental qualities in & of themselves. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities, or on the phenomenon of origination & passing away with regard to mental qualities. Or his mindfulness that 'There are mental qualities' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world.

And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in & of themselves with reference to the seven factors for Awakening? There is the case where, there being mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within, a monk discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is present within me.' Or, there being no mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within, he discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is not present within me.' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen mindfulness as a factor for Awakening. And he discerns how there is the culmination of the development of mindfulness as a factor for Awakening once it has arisen. [The same formula is repeated for the remaining factors for Awakening: analysis of qualities, persistence, rapture, serenity, concentration, & equanimity.]"In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in & of themselves, or externally... unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in & of themselves with reference to the seven factors for Awakening..."Now, in anyone who would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here & now, or — if there be any remnant of clinging/sustenance — non-return."Let alone seven years. In anyone who would develop these four frames of reference in this way for six years... five... four... three... two years... one year... seven months... six months... five... four... three... two months... one month... half a month, one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here & now, or — if there be any remnant of clinging/sustenance — non-return."Let alone half a month. In anyone who would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven days, one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here & now, or — if there be any remnant of clinging/sustenance — non-return."'This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow & lamentation, for the disappearance of pain & distress, for the attainment of the right method, & for the realization of Unbinding — in other words, the four frames of reference.' Thus was it said, and in reference to this was it said."

§ 38. Breath Meditation.§ 38."And how is mindfulness of in-&-out breathing developed & pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination?"On whatever occasion a monk (1) breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long, discerns that he is breathing out long; (2) or breathing in short, discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, discerns that he is breathing out short; (3) trains himself to breathe in... &... out sensitive to the entire body; (4) trains himself to breathe in... &... out calming bodily fabrications: On that occasion, monks, the monk remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this — the in-&-out breath — is classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world.body"On whatever occasion a monk (5) trains himself to breathe in... &... out sensitive to rapture; (6) trains himself to breathe in... &... out sensitive to pleasure; (7) trains himself to breathe in... &... out sensitive to mental fabrications; (8) trains himself to breathe in... &... out calming mental fabrications: On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in & of themselves — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world.

I don't say that there is mindfulness of in-&-out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no presence of mind, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world.mind"On whatever occasion a monk (13) trains himself to breathe in... &... out focusing on inconstancy; (14) trains himself to breathe in... &... out focusing on dispassion; (15) trains himself to breathe in... &... out focusing on cessation; (16) trains himself to breathe in... &... out focusing on relinquishment: On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in & of themselves — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world.

§ 39.

He remains focused on feelings... mind... mental qualities in & of themselves — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world. Just as if an elephant trainer were to plant a large post in the ground and were to bind a forest elephant to it by the neck in order to overcome its forest habits, overcome its forest memories & resolves, overcome its distraction, fatigue, & fever over leaving the forest, to make it delight in the town and to inculcate in it habits congenial to human beings. In the same way, these four frames of reference are bindings for the awareness of the disciple of the noble ones, for the sake of overcoming his household habits, overcoming his household memories & resolves, overcoming his distraction, fatigue, & fever over leaving the household life, for the attainment of the right method and the realization of Unbinding."Then the Tathagata trains him further: "Come, monk, remain focused on the body in & of itself, but do not think any thoughts connected with the body. Remain focused on feelings in & of themselves, but do not think any thoughts connected with feelings. Remain focused on the mind in & of itself, but do not think any thoughts connected with mind.

§ 41."These are the four developments of concentration. What four? There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now. There is the development of concentration that... leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision. There is the development of concentration that... leads to mindfulness & alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents."And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now? There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities — enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation — internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress — he enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is the development of concentration that... leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now."And what is the development of concentration that... leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision? There is the case where a monk has the perception of light, the perception of daytime (at any hour of the day) well-fixed & well in hand. Day (for him) is the same as night, night is the same as day. By means of an awareness open & unhampered, he develops a brightened mind. This is the development of concentration that... leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision."And what is the development of concentration that... leads to mindfulness & alertness? There is the case where a monk is conscious of feelings as they arise, as they persist, as they go totally to their end. He is conscious of perceptions as they arise, as they persist, as they go totally to their end. He is conscious of thoughts as they arise, as they persist, as they go totally to their end. This is the development of concentration that... leads to mindfulness & alertness."And what is the development of concentration that... leads to the ending of the effluents? There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising & falling away with reference to the five clinging-aggregates: 'Such is form, such its origination, such its passing away. Such is feeling... Such is perception... Such are fabrications... Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its passing away.' This is the development of concentration that... leads to the ending of the effluents."These are the four developments of concentration."

§ 42."Now what, monks, is the five-factored noble right concentration? There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities — enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. He permeates & pervades, suffuses & fills this very body with the rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal."Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again & again with water, so that his ball of bath powder — saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within & without — would nevertheless not drip; even so, monks, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture & pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal. This is the first development of the five-factored noble right concentration."Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, one-pointedness of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation — internal assurance. He permeates & pervades, suffuses & fills this very body with the rapture & pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture & pleasure born of composure."Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from east, west, north or south, and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate & pervade, suffuse & fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so monks, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture & pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture & pleasure born of composure. This is the second development of the five-factored noble right concentration."And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He permeates & pervades, suffuses & fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture, so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture."Just as in a blue-, white-, or red-lotus pond, there may be some of the blue, white, or red lotuses which, born & growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated & pervaded, suffused & filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those blue, white, or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, monks, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture. This is the third development of the five-factored noble right concentration."And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure & stress — as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress — he enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness, so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness."Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, monks, the monk sits, permeating his body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness. This is the fourth development of the five-factored noble right concentration."And furthermore, the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand, well attended to, well-pondered, well-penetrated by means of discernment."Just as if one person were to reflect on another, or a standing person were to reflect on a sitting person, or a sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down; even so, monks, the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand, well attended to, well-pondered, well-penetrated by means of discernment. This is the fifth development of the five-factored noble right concentration."When a monk has developed & pursued the five-factored noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know & realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening."Suppose that there were a water jar, set on a stand, brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it. If a strong man were to tip it in any way at all, would water spill out?""Yes, lord.""In the same way, when a monk has developed & pursued the five-factored noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know & realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening."Suppose there were a rectangular water tank — set on level round, bounded by dykes — brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it. If a strong man were to loosen the dykes anywhere at all, would water spill out?""Yes, lord...""Suppose there were a chariot on level ground at four crossroads, harnessed to thoroughbreds, waiting with whips lying ready, so that a skilled driver, a trainer of tamable horses, might mount and — taking the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right — drive out & back, to whatever place and by whichever road he liked; in the same way, when a monk has developed & pursued the five-factored noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know & realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening."

§ 43.§ 43. There's		no jhana for one with	no discernment, 		   no discernment for one with	no jhana.  But one with   both jhana 		   & discernment is on the verge 		   of Unbinding. — Dhp 372

§ 44. Concentration & Discernment.§ 44."Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay, so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances, to fire accurate shots in rapid succession, & to pierce great masses. In the same way, there is the case where a monk... enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born of withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form, feeling, perception, fabrications, & consciousness as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. He turns his mind away from those phenomena, and having done so, inclines his mind to the quality of deathlessness: 'This is peace, this is exquisite — the resolution of all fabrications, the relinquishment of all mental acquisitions, the passing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Unbinding.'"Having attained this point, he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations. Or, if not, then — through passion & delight for this very quality [the discernment inclining to deathlessness] and from the total wasting away of the first five of the Fetters [self-identity views, grasping at precepts & practices, uncertainty, sensual passion, and resistance] — he is due to be reborn [in the Pure Abodes], there to be totally unbound, never again to return from that world." (Similarly with the remaining levels of jhana.)
0.45
§ 45. Discernment & Release.§ 45."With his mind thus concentrated, purified, & bright, the monk directs it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen — clear, limpid, & unsullied — where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, & pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about & resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, & unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, & pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about & resting.' In the same way, the monk discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentations of sensuality, becoming, & ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' This, too, is a reward of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. And as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life, higher & more sublime than this, there is none."

§ 46.§ 46. Washing my feet, I noticed 	   the 	   water. And in watching it flow from high 	   to 	   low, 	my heart was composed 	like a fine thoroughbred steed. Then taking a lamp, I entered the hut, 	checked the bedding, 	sat down on the bed. And taking a pin, I pulled out the wick: 	Like the flame's unbinding 	was the liberation 	   of awareness. — Thig 5.10 
1.1
  The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and   unchanging Tao.  The name that can be named is not the enduring and   unchanging name.     (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven   and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all   things.     Always without desire we must be found,      If its deep mystery we would sound;      But if desire always within us be,      Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.     Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development   takes place, it receives the different names.  Together we call them   the Mystery.  Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that   is subtle and wonderful.    
1.2
  All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing   this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill   of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the   want of skill is.     So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to   (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the   idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the   figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from   the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and   tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and   that being before and behind give the idea of one following another.     Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and   conveys his instructions without the use of speech.     All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show   itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership;   they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a   reward for the results).  The work is accomplished, and there is no   resting in it (as an achievement).        The work is done, but how no one can see;     'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be.    
1.3
  Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to   keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles   which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming   thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is   the way to keep their minds from disorder.     Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties   their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens   their bones.     He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without   desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them   from presuming to act (on it).  When there is this abstinence from   action, good order is universal.    
1.4
  The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our   employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness.  How   deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of   all things!     We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of   things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into   agreement with the obscurity of others.  How pure and still the Tao   is, as if it would ever so continue!     I do not know whose son it is.  It might appear to have been before   God.    
1.5
  Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be   benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt   with.  The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they   deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.     May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a   bellows?       'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power;     'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more.      Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see;      Your inner being guard, and keep it free.    
1.6
  The valley spirit dies not, aye the same;      The female mystery thus do we name.      Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,      Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth.      Long and unbroken does its power remain,      Used gently, and without the touch of pain.    
1.7
  Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long.  The reason   why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is   because they do not live of, or for, themselves.  This is how they are   able to continue and endure.     Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in   the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him,   and yet that person is preserved.  Is it not because he has no   personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised?    
1.8
  The highest excellence is like (that of) water.  The excellence   of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying,   without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men   dislike.  Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao.     The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place;   that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in   their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing   good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and   that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness.     And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about   his low position), no one finds fault with him.    
1.9
  It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to   carry it when it is full.  If you keep feeling a point that has been   sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.     When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them   safe.  When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil   on itself.  When the work is done, and one's name is becoming   distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven.    
1.10
  When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one   embrace, they can be kept from separating.  When one gives undivided   attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of   pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe.  When he has cleansed away   the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without   a flaw.     In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed   without any (purpose of) action?  In the opening and shutting of his   gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird?  While his   intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be   without knowledge?     (The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces   them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not   boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them.   This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao).    
1.11
  The thirty spokes unite in the one nave; but it is on the empty   space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends.  Clay is   fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that   their use depends.  The door and windows are cut out (from the walls)   to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its   use depends.  Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for   profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness.    
1.12
  Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take;      Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make;      The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste;      The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste      Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange,      Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change.     Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and   not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes.  He puts from him the   latter, and prefers to seek the former.    
1.13
  Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and   great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same   kind).     What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace?  Disgrace is   being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour).  The getting   that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing   it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is   meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be   feared.     And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be   (similarly) regarded as personal conditions?  What makes me liable to   great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had   not the body, what great calamity could come to me?     Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he   honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would   administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be   entrusted with it.    
1.14
  We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the   Equable.'  We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the   Inaudible.'  We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we   name it 'the Subtle.'  With these three qualities, it cannot be made   the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and   obtain The One.     Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure.   Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again   returns and becomes nothing.  This is called the Form of the Formless,   and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and   Indeterminable.     We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see   its Back.  When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things   of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the   beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao.    
1.15
  The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle   and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep   (also) so as to elude men's knowledge.  As they were thus beyond men's   knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they   appeared to be.     Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in   winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave   like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting   away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into   anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.     Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)?  Let it be still, and it   will gradually become clear.  Who can secure the condition of rest?   Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise.     They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of   themselves).  It is through their not being full of themselves that   they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete.    
1.16
  The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree,   and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour.  All things   alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them   return (to their original state).  When things (in the vegetable   world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them   return to its root.  This returning to their root is what we call the   state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that   they have fulfilled their appointed end.     The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule.  To   know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads   to wild movements and evil issues.  The knowledge of that unchanging   rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity   and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things).   From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he   who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like.  In that likeness to   heaven he possesses the Tao.  Possessed of the Tao, he endures long;   and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.    
1.17
  In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there   were (their rulers).  In the next age they loved them and praised   them.  In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them.   Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers)   a want of faith in them ensued (in the people).     How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by   their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words!   Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the   people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!'    
1.18
  When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed,   benevolence and righteousness came into vogue.  (Then) appeared wisdom   and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy.     When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships,   filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell   into disorder, loyal ministers appeared.    
1.19
  If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it   would be better for the people a hundredfold.  If we could renounce   our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again   become filial and kindly.  If we could renounce our artful   contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no   thieves nor robbers.     Those three methods (of government)      Thought olden ways in elegance did fail      And made these names their want of worth to veil;      But simple views, and courses plain and true      Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew.    
1.20
  When we renounce learning we have no troubles.      The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'--      Small is the difference they display.      But mark their issues, good and ill;--      What space the gulf between shall fill?     What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end   is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)!     The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a   full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring.  I alone seem   listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of   their presence.  I am like an infant which has not yet smiled.  I look   dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to.  The multitude of   men all have enough and to spare.  I alone seem to have lost   everything.  My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of   chaos.     Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be   benighted.  They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull   and confused.  I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as   if I had nowhere to rest.  All men have their spheres of action, while   I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer.  (Thus) I alone   am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao).    
1.21
  The grandest forms of active force       From Tao come, their only source.       Who can of Tao the nature tell?       Our sight it flies, our touch as well.       Eluding sight, eluding touch,       The forms of things all in it crouch;       Eluding touch, eluding sight,       There are their semblances, all right.       Profound it is, dark and obscure;       Things' essences all there endure.       Those essences the truth enfold       Of what, when seen, shall then be told.       Now it is so; 'twas so of old.       Its name--what passes not away;       So, in their beautiful array,       Things form and never know decay.     How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things?  By   this (nature of the Tao).    
1.22
  The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty,   full; the worn out, new.  He whose (desires) are few gets them; he   whose (desires) are many goes astray.     Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of   humility), and manifests it to all the world.  He is free from self-   display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore   he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is   acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires   superiority.  It is because he is thus free from striving that   therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him.     That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was   not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it.    
1.23
  Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity   of his nature.  A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a   sudden rain does not last for the whole day.  To whom is it that these   (two) things are owing?  To Heaven and Earth.  If Heaven and Earth   cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man!     Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are   also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the   manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while   even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where   they fail.     Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness   of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation   have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees   in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao).   (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of   faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others).    
1.24
  He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches   his legs does not walk (easily).  (So), he who displays himself does   not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who   vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self-   conceited has no superiority allowed to him.  Such conditions, viewed   from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour   on the body, which all dislike.  Hence those who pursue (the course)   of the Tao do not adopt and allow them.  
1.25
  There was something undefined and complete, coming into   existence before Heaven and Earth.  How still it was and formless,   standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in   no danger (of being exhausted)!  It may be regarded as the Mother of   all things.     I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao   (the Way or Course).  Making an effort (further) to give it a name I   call it The Great.     Great, it passes on (in constant flow).  Passing on, it becomes   remote.  Having become remote, it returns.  Therefore the Tao is   great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also   great.  In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage)   king is one of them.     Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from   Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao.  The law of the Tao is its   being what it is.    
1.26
  Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of   movement.     Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far   from his baggage waggons.  Although he may have brilliant prospects to   look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to   them.  How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly   before the kingdom?  If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of   gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne.    
1.27
  The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or   footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault   with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful   closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be   impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to   unloose what he has bound will be impossible.  In the same way the   sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any   man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast   away anything.  This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.'     Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him   who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of   (the reputation of) him who has the skill.  If the one did not honour   his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an   (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them.  This is   called 'The utmost degree of mystery.'    
1.28
  Who knows his manhood's strength,      Yet still his female feebleness maintains;      As to one channel flow the many drains,      All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky.      Thus he the constant excellence retains;      The simple child again, free from all stains.        Who knows how white attracts,      Yet always keeps himself within black's shade,      The pattern of humility displayed,      Displayed in view of all beneath the sky;      He in the unchanging excellence arrayed,      Endless return to man's first state has made.        Who knows how glory shines,      Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale;      Behold his presence in a spacious vale,      To which men come from all beneath the sky.      The unchanging excellence completes its tale;      The simple infant man in him we hail.     The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms   vessels.  The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the   Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs   no violent measures.    
1.29
  If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to   effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed.  The   kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing.  He   who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp   loses it.     The course and nature of things is such that      What was in front is now behind;      What warmed anon we freezing find.      Strength is of weakness oft the spoil;      The store in ruins mocks our toil.     Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy   indulgence.    
1.30
  He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will   not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms.  Such a course   is sure to meet with its proper return.     Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up.  In the   sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years.     A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops.  He does   not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his   mastery.  He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against   being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it.  He strikes   it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for   mastery.     When things have attained their strong maturity they become old.   This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not   in accordance with it soon comes to an end.    
1.31
  Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen,   hateful, it may be said, to all creatures.  Therefore they who have   the Tao do not like to employ them.     The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most   honourable place, but in time of war the right hand.  Those sharp   weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the   superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity.  Calm   and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him   undesirable.  To consider this desirable would be to delight in the   slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot   get his will in the kingdom.     On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized   position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand.  The second in   command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding   in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him   as in the rites of mourning.  He who has killed multitudes of men   should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in   battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites.    
1.32
  The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name.     Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole   world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister.  If a   feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would   spontaneously submit themselves to him.     Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down   the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally   everywhere as of its own accord.     As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name.  When it once has   that name, (men) can know to rest in it.  When they know to rest in   it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error.     The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great   rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys.    
1.33
  He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is   intelligent.  He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes   himself is mighty.  He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who   goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will.     He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues   long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity.    
1.34
  All-pervading is the Great Tao!  It may be found on the left   hand and on the right.     All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to   them, not one refusing obedience to it.  When its work is   accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it.  It   clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being   their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things.  All things   return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it   which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest   things.     Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great   achievements.  It is through his not making himself great that he can   accomplish them.    
1.35
  To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible   Tao), the whole world repairs.  Men resort to him, and receive no   hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease.     Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time).   But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has   no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to,   the use of it is inexhaustible.    
1.36
  When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a   (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will   first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will   first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will   first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of   his procedure).'     The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong.     Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the   profit of a state should not be shown to the people.    
1.37
  The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of   doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do.     If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of   themselves be transformed by them.     If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would   express the desire by the nameless simplicity.        Simplicity without a name      Is free from all external aim.      With no desire, at rest and still,      All things go right as of their will.    
1.38
  (Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the   Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them   (in fullest measure).  (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those   attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not   possess them (in fullest measure).     (Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did   nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything.  (Those who)   possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to   be so doing.     (Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking)   to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so.  (Those who)   possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it   out, and had need to be so doing.     (Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always   seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared   the arm and marched up to them.     Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared;   when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence   was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the   proprieties appeared.     Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good   faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is   (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity.     Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews   what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower.  It is   thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other.    
1.39
  The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are--        Heaven which by it is bright and pure;      Earth rendered thereby firm and sure;      Spirits with powers by it supplied;      Valleys kept full throughout their void      All creatures which through it do live      Princes and kings who from it get      The model which to all they give.     All these are the results of the One (Tao).     If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend;      If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend;      Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail;      If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale;      Without that life, creatures would pass away;      Princes and kings, without that moral sway,      However grand and high, would all decay.     Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous)   meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from   which it rises).  Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,'   'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.'  Is not this   an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see   the foundation of their dignity?  So it is that in the enumeration of   the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it   answer the ends of a carriage.  They do not wish to show themselves   elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an   (ordinary) stone.    
1.40
  The movement of the Tao        By contraries proceeds;      And weakness marks the course        Of Tao's mighty deeds.     All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named);   that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named).    
1.41
  Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao,   earnestly carry it into practice.  Scholars of the middle class, when   they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it.   Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh   greatly at it.  If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit   to be the Tao.     Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:--       'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack;      Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back;      Its even way is like a rugged track.      Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise;      Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes;      And he has most whose lot the least supplies.      Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low;      Its solid truth seems change to undergo;      Its largest square doth yet no corner show      A vessel great, it is the slowest made;      Loud is its sound, but never word it said;      A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.'     The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is   skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them   complete.    
1.42
  The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three;   Three produced All things.  All things leave behind them the Obscurity   (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the   Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised   by the Breath of Vacancy.     What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as   carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which   kings and princes use for themselves.  So it is that some things are   increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being   increased.     What other men (thus) teach, I also teach.  The violent and strong   do not die their natural death.  I will make this the basis of my   teaching.    
1.43
  The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the   hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there   is no crevice.  I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing   (with a purpose).     There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without   words, and the advantage arising from non-action.    
1.44
  Or fame or life,        Which do you hold more dear?      Or life or wealth,        To which would you adhere?      Keep life and lose those other things;      Keep them and lose your life:--which brings        Sorrow and pain more near?     Thus we may see,        Who cleaves to fame        Rejects what is more great;      Who loves large stores        Gives up the richer state.     Who is content      Needs fear no shame.      Who knows to stop      Incurs no blame.      From danger free      Long live shall he.    
1.45
  Who thinks his great achievements poor      Shall find his vigour long endure.      Of greatest fulness, deemed a void,      Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide.      Do thou what's straight still crooked deem;      Thy greatest art still stupid seem,      And eloquence a stammering scream.     Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat.  Purity   and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven.    
1.46
  When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift   horses to (draw) the dung-carts.  When the Tao is disregarded in the   world, the war-horses breed in the border lands.     There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity   greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than   the wish to be getting.  Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is   an enduring and unchanging sufficiency.    
1.47
  Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes   place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees   the Tao of Heaven.  The farther that one goes out (from himself), the   less he knows.     Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave   their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished   their ends without any purpose of doing so.    
1.48
  He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to   increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks)   from day to day to diminish (his doing).     He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing   nothing (on purpose).  Having arrived at this point of non-action,   there is nothing which he does not do.     He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself   no trouble (with that end).  If one take trouble (with that end), he   is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven.    
1.49
  The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind   of the people his mind.     To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not   good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good.  To   those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are   not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be   sincere.     The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps   his mind in a state of indifference to all.  The people all keep their   eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his   children.  
1.50
  Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die.     Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three   are ministers of death.     There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose   movements tend to the land (or place) of death.  And for what reason?   Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life.     But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life   entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun   rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff   coat or sharp weapon.  The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which   to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws,   nor the weapon a place to admit its point.  And for what reason?   Because there is in him no place of death.    
1.51
  All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its   outflowing operation.  They receive their forms according to the   nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of   their condition.  Therefore all things without exception honour the   Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation.     This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the   result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute.     Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them,   brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures   them, maintains them, and overspreads them.     It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it   carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in   doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over   them;--this is called its mysterious operation.    
1.52
  (The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be   considered as the mother of them all.     When the mother is found, we know what her children should be.   When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard   (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his   life he will be free from all peril.     Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his   nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion.   Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion   of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him.     The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear-   sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret   of) strength.     Who uses well his light,      Reverting to its (source so) bright,      Will from his body ward all blight,      And hides the unchanging from men's sight.    
1.53
  If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position   to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should   be most afraid of would be a boastful display.     The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the   by-ways.     Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their   fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty.  They   shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their   girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a   superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called   robbers and boasters.  This is contrary to the Tao surely!    
1.54
  What (Tao's) skilful planter plants        Can never be uptorn;      What his skilful arms enfold,        From him can ne'er be borne.      Sons shall bring in lengthening line,      Sacrifices to his shrine.     Tao when nursed within one's self,        His vigour will make true;      And where the family it rules        What riches will accrue!      The neighbourhood where it prevails        In thriving will abound;      And when 'tis seen throughout the state,        Good fortune will be found.      Employ it the kingdom o'er,        And men thrive all around.     In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the   observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood;   in the state; and in the kingdom.     How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the   sky?  By this (method of observation).    
1.55
  He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is   like an infant.  Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts   will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him.     (The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its   grasp is firm.  It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet   its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its   physical essence.  All day long it will cry without its throat   becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution).     To him by whom this harmony is known,      (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown,      And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne.      All life-increasing arts to evil turn;      Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn,      (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.)     When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may   be said to be contrary to the Tao.  Whatever is  contrary to the Tao   soon ends.    
1.56
  He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he   who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it.     He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals   (of his nostrils).  He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the   complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring   himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others).  This is called   'the Mysterious Agreement.'     (Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is   beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or   meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven.    
1.57
  A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of   war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's   own (only) by freedom from action and purpose.     How do I know that it is so?  By these facts:--In the kingdom the   multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the   people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people   have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more   acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange   contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the   more thieves and robbers there are.     Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the   people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping   still, and the people will of themselves become correct.  I will take   no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I   will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to   the primitive simplicity.'    
1.58
  The government that seems the most unwise,      Oft goodness to the people best supplies;      That which is meddling, touching everything,      Will work but ill, and disappointment bring.     Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side!  Happiness!--misery   lurks beneath it!  Who knows what either will come to in the end?     Shall we then dispense with correction?  The (method of) correction   shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn   become evil.  The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed   subsisted for a long time.     Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its   angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness).   He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright,   but does not dazzle.    
1.59
  For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering   the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like   moderation.     It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early   return (to man's normal state).  That early return is what I call the   repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao).  With that   repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation   (of every obstacle to such return).  Of this subjugation we know not   what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall   be, he may be the ruler of a state.     He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long.  His   case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are   deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its   enduring life shall long be seen.    
1.60
  Governing a great state is like cooking small fish.     Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of   the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy.  It is not that   those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be   employed to hurt men.  It is not that it could not hurt men, but   neither does the ruling sage hurt them.     When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good   influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao).    
1.61
  What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down-   flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small   states) under heaven.     (To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always   overcomes the male by her stillness.  Stillness may be considered (a   sort of) abasement.     Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states,   gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to   a great state, win it over to them.  In the one case the abasement   leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour.     The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them;   a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other.   Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase   itself.    
1.62
  Tao has of all things the most honoured place.      No treasures give good men so rich a grace;      Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface.     (Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds   can raise their performer above others.  Even men who are not good are   not abandoned by it.     Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of   Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a   prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill   both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in   the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of)   this Tao, which one might present on his knees.     Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much?  Was it not   because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape   (from the stain of their guilt) by it?  This is the reason why all   under heaven consider it the most valuable thing.    
1.63
  (It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting;   to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste   without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great,   and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness.     (The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they   are easy, and does things that would become great while they are   small.  All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a   previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one   in which they were small.  Therefore the sage, while he never does   what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest   things.     He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is   continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult.   Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so   never has any difficulties.    
1.64
  That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing   has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures   against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very   small is easily dispersed.  Action should be taken before a thing has   made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has   begun.     The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the   tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey   of a thousand li commenced with a single step.     He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold   of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold.  The sage does not act   (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and   therefore does not lose his bold.  (But) people in their conduct of   affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of   success.  If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the   beginning, they would not so ruin them.     Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does   not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not   learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by.   Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare   to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own).

  The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did   so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and   ignorant.     The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having   much knowledge.  He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a   scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing.     He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and   rule.  Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call   the mysterious excellence (of a governor).  Deep and far-reaching is   such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite   to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him.    
1.66
  That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage   and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower   than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all.  So it is   that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his   words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person   behind them.     In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his   weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an   injury to them.     Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of   him.  Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive   with him.    
1.67
  All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears   to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).   Now it is just its   greatness that makes it seem to be inferior.  If it were like any   other (system), for long would its smallness have been known!     But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast.  The   first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking   from taking precedence of others.     With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be   liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a   vessel of the highest honour.  Now-a-days they give up gentleness and   are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the   hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end   is) death.     Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to   maintain its ground.  Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very)   gentleness protecting him.    
1.68
  He who in (Tao's) wars has skill         Assumes no martial port;       He who fights with most good will         To rage makes no resort.       He who vanquishes yet still         Keeps from his foes apart;       He whose hests men most fulfil         Yet humbly plies his art.         Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends,         And therein is his might.'       Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends,         That they with him unite.'       Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends,         No sage of old more bright.'    
1.69
  A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the   host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the   defensive).  I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a   foot.'  This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks;   baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping   the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the   enemy where there is no enemy.     There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war.  To do   that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious.  Thus it is   that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores   (the situation) conquers.    
1.70
  My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but   there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise   them.     There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my   words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce).  It   is because they do not know these, that men do not know me.     They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be   prized.  It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth,   while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom.    
1.71
  To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest   (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease.     It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this   disease that we are preserved from it.  The sage has not the disease.   He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he   does not have it.    
1.72
  When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which   is their great dread will come on them.     Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary   life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on.     It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not   arise.     Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not   parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value   on, himself.  And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes   choice of the former.    
1.73
  He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in   defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in   his not daring (to do so) lives on.  Of these two cases the one   appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious.  But        When Heaven's anger smites a man,      Who the cause shall truly scan?     On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the   former case).     It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully   overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply;   does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves.  Its   demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective.   The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting   nothing escape.    
1.74
  The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to)   frighten them with death?  If the people were always in awe of death,   and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death,   who would dare to do wrong?     There is always One who presides over the infliction death.  He who   would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be   described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter.  Seldom is it   that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter,   does not cut his own hands!  
1.75
  The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes   consumed by their superiors.  It is through this that they suffer   famine.     The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive)   agency of their superiors (in governing them).  It is through this   that they are difficult to govern.     The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their   labours in seeking for the means of living.  It is this which makes   them think light of dying.  Thus it is that to leave the subject of   living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on   it.    
1.76
  Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and   strong.  (So it is with) all things.  Trees and plants, in their early   growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered.     Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of   death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life.     Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not   conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms,   (and thereby invites the feller.)     Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that   of what is soft and weak is above.    
1.77
  May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method     of) bending a bow?  The (part of the bow) which was high is brought   low, and what was low is raised up.  (So Heaven) diminishes where   there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency.     It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to   supplement deficiency.  It is not so with the way of man.  He takes   away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance.     Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under   heaven?  Only he who is in possession of the Tao!     Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as   his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he   does not wish to display his superiority.    
1.78
  There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water,   and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing   that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual)   for which it can be changed.     Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and   the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice.     Therefore a sage has said,     'He who accepts his state's reproach,        Is hailed therefore its altars' lord;      To him who bears men's direful woes        They all the name of King accord.'     Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical.    
1.79
  When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a   great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind   of the one who was wrong).  And how can this be beneficial (to the   other)?     Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand   portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the   (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party.  (So), he who has the   attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the   engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the   conditions favourable to himself.     In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always   on the side of the good man.    
1.80
  In a little state with a small population, I would so order it,   that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a   hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the   people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove   elsewhere (to avoid it).     Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion   to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they   should have no occasion to don or use them.     I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead   of the written characters).     They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes   beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common   (simple) ways sources of enjoyment.     There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices   of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I   would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any   intercourse with it.    
1.81
  Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere.  Those   who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the   disputatious are not skilled in it.  Those who know (the Tao) are not   extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.     The sage does not accumulate (for himself).  The more that he   expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that   he gives to others, the more does he have himself.     With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with   all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.
